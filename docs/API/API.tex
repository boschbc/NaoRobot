\begin{abstract}
This document describes the API through which the GOAL and Nao clients communicate with each other.
\end{abstract}

\section{Connection Establishment}
Connection to the GOAL client is established through port 6474.

\section{Events}
Communication consists of units called \"events\". The transmission of an event begins by transmitting its unique byte-code, optionally followed by any additional arguments specific to that event.

Some events are sent by the Nao client, others by the GOAL client. Each GOAL-to-Nao command generates either a Success, Failure or Error events in return. These are initialised by the Nao client and sent over to GOAL in order to report the status of the original command.

\subsection{GOAL to Nao}
The following events are sent exclusively from the GOAL client to the Nao one. \\
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{2.2cm} | p{8cm} | }
\hline
\textbf{Event} & \textbf{Code} & \textbf{Arguments} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Exit & 0x0 & \textit{None} & The Nao will sit down, terminate the connection and exit its program. \\ \hline
GoTo & 0x1 & \textbf{MarkerID} \newline \textbf{Distance} & The Nao will walk towards the marker with ID \textit{MarkerID} and stop \textit{Distance} rooms in front of it. Emits a Failure event if the marker cannot be spotted. \\ \hline
PickUp & 0x2 & \textbf{ObjectID} & The Nao will position itself in front of the object with ID \textit{ObjectID} and then pick it up. Emits a failure event if the object cannot be spotted or if it is unreachable. \\ \hline
PutDown & 0x3 & \textit{None} & The Nao will gently lay down the object it currently holds. Emits a Failure event if the Nao is not holding anything. \\ \hline
Halt & 0x4 & \textit{None} & The Nao will stop moving. Emits a Failure event if the Nao is currently in the process of grabbing an object or putting it down. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Nao to GOAL}
The following events are sent exclusively from the Nao client to the GOAL one. \\
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | p{2.2cm} | p{8cm} | }
\hline
\textbf{Event} & \textbf{Code} & \textbf{Arguments} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Error & 0x8 & \textit{None} & A fatal error has occurred in the Nao. Its current state is unknown. \\ \hline
Success & 0x81 & \textbf{Code} & The last GOAL-to-Nao event with code \textit{Code} has been executed successfully. \\ \hline
Failure & 0x82 & \textbf{Code} & The last GOAL-to-Nao event with code \textit{Code} has failed its execution. \\ \hline
Location & 0x89 & \textbf{MarkerID} & The Nao is currently at the room with marker ID \textit{MarkerID} \\ \hline
See & 0x8A & \textbf{MarkerID} \newline \textbf{Distance} & The Nao spotted the marker with ID \textit{MarkerID} at \textit{Distance} rooms away. If \textit{Distance == 0} the Nao is in the same room as the object.  \\ \hline 
Dropped & 0x8C &  \textbf{ObjectID} & The Nao has either dropped or put down the object with ID \textit{ObjectID} \\ \hline
Holding & 0x8D & \textbf{ObjectID} & The Nao has picked up the object with ID \textit{ObjectID} \\ \hline
Agent & 0x8E & \textbf{AgentID} & This Nao instance has ID \textit{AgentID} \\ \hline
State & 0x8F & \textbf{State} & This Nao is in state \textit{State}. Where \newline \textit{State = 0 = halted.} \newline \textit{State = 1 = walking.} \newline Sent on change. \\ \hline
